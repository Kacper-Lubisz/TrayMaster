# TrayMaster
[![GitHub Actions CI Badge](https://github.com/Kacper-Lubisz/TrayMaster/workflows/Node%20CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Kacper-Lubisz/TrayMaster/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Node+CI%22)

TrayMaster is a software application primarily intended for managing trays of perishable stock on shelves inside a warehouse.
It has been designed following consultation and analysis of the processes currently in use at [Durham Christian 
Partnership](http://www.durhamcp.org.uk/)â€™s [Chester-le-Street foodstore](https://durham.foodbank.org.uk/); but more
generally will be applicable to many other [Trussell Trust](https://www.trusselltrust.org/)\-affiliated foodbanks across the
UK, as well as other sectors with physical stock located within trays where incoming stock is hard to predict. This software
should complement existing workflows and aid warehouse staff in their day-to-day activities.

It was designed to allow for warehouses to be modelled digitally, with the primary aim of assisting with the existing
workflows of foodstore staff by:
- Providing an efficient, flexible and intuitive stocktaking interface to maximise data collection speed
- Minimising food wastage by allowing the warehouse to be queried for trays expiring soon
- Allowing statistics and reports to be compiled from the data stored about the warehouse
